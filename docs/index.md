# Introduction


**Welcome to the Cognite Data Fusion Technical Bootcamp!**

This course will guide you through a hands-on example to develop production-ready solutions with Cognite Data Fusion(CDF). While it is possible to grant access and ingest, transform, and contextualize data manually in CDF through the User Interface, creating a proper CI/CD pipeline that allows the development team to promote the project through different environments (e.g. test & prod) is essential in creating a production-ready solution.

The course has been developed by CDF & DataOps experts and aims to share this knowledge with the community. It follows DataOps principles to ensure that each step is repeatable and produces data products that can be trusted.
